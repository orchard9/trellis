# Why Trellis Ingress?

## The Traffic Ingestion Problem

Traditional traffic tracking systems fail at the most critical moment: when traffic arrives. Here's why:

### 1. **Pre-Configuration Requirements**
Most systems require upfront setup:
- Traffic sources must be pre-defined
- Parameter mappings must exist before first click
- Campaign structures must be created before traffic flows
- Miss the setup, lose the data forever

### 2. **Integration Complexity**
Every traffic source speaks differently:
- Different parameter names (`click_id` vs `cid` vs `transaction_id`)
- Different data formats (JSON vs form-encoded vs query params)
- Different authentication methods
- Custom protocols and requirements

### 3. **Data Loss Risk**
Traditional systems lose data when:
- New traffic sources send unexpected parameters
- Systems go down during high-traffic periods
- Integration bugs cause data corruption
- Configuration changes break existing flows

## The Ingress Solution

**Capture Everything, Immediately**

Trellis Ingress is built on the principle that **every byte of traffic data is valuable**, even if we don't understand it yet.

### Core Principles

1. **Universal Acceptance**
   - Accept traffic from ANY source without pre-configuration
   - Capture ALL parameters, regardless of format
   - Store complete request context (headers, body, timing)
   - Never reject traffic due to unknown format

2. **Organization Isolation** 
   - Complete data separation between organizations
   - Authentication-based traffic scoping
   - Zero data leakage between tenants
   - Secure multi-tenant architecture

3. **Zero Data Loss**
   - Fire-and-forget asynchronous processing
   - Redundant storage with automatic failover  
   - Buffering and retry mechanisms
   - Complete audit trail of all traffic

### The Ingress Advantage

**Before Trellis Ingress:**
```
New Partner → "Can you set up tracking?" → 2 weeks integration → Maybe works
```

**With Trellis Ingress:**
```
New Partner → "Send traffic now" → Instant capture → Figure out later
```

## Real-World Impact

### Problem: New Partner Integration
**Traditional System**: "We need 2 weeks to integrate your tracking parameters."
**Trellis Ingress**: "Send traffic right now. We're already capturing everything."

### Problem: Unexpected Traffic Spike  
**Traditional System**: System overloaded, data lost, attribution broken.
**Trellis Ingress**: Auto-scaling ingestion, zero data loss, complete attribution.

### Problem: Parameter Changes
**Traditional System**: "They changed their parameter format. We lost 3 days of data."
**Trellis Ingress**: "We captured everything. Let's retroactively create the new mapping."

## Technical Excellence

### Performance First
- **Sub-100ms redirects**: Fast enough for real-time user experience
- **100K+ requests/second**: Handle traffic spikes without degradation
- **Horizontal scaling**: Add nodes to handle any traffic volume
- **Edge deployment**: Global distribution for lowest latency

### Reliability Built-In
- **99.99% uptime**: Redundancy at every layer
- **Circuit breakers**: Graceful degradation under load
- **Health monitoring**: Proactive issue detection
- **Automatic recovery**: Self-healing architecture

### Organization Security
- **API key authentication**: Secure access control via Warden
- **Complete data isolation**: Zero cross-contamination
- **Audit logging**: Full activity tracking
- **Role-based permissions**: Granular access control

## Why Now?

1. **Cloud Infrastructure Maturity**: Auto-scaling, managed databases, global CDNs
2. **Storage Cost Reduction**: Keeping everything costs less than losing anything
3. **Real-Time Processing**: Stream processing enables immediate action
4. **Organization Awareness**: Multi-tenancy is table stakes for SaaS

## The Bottom Line

Traffic ingestion shouldn't be the bottleneck in your attribution pipeline. With Trellis Ingress:

- **Every click is captured**, even from unknown sources
- **Every parameter is preserved**, even if we don't understand it yet  
- **Every organization is isolated**, with complete data security
- **Every redirect is fast**, maintaining user experience

Stop losing money by losing data. Start capturing value from every traffic source, immediately.
