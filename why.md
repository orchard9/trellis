# Why Trellis Platform?

## The $50 Billion Problem

Marketing attribution is fundamentally broken. Not "needs improvement" brokenâ€”**architecturally, systematically broken**.

Every major advertising platform, analytics tool, and attribution system makes the same critical mistake: they force you to decide what to measure before the data arrives. This creates an unsolvable chicken-and-egg problem that costs the industry billions in lost opportunities.

## The Three Services That Solve It

Trellis is a domain-focused platform consisting of three specialized services that work together to revolutionize traffic attribution:

### ðŸš€ Ingress: Universal Traffic Capture
**"Capture Everything, Redirect Immediately"**

The high-performance ingestion engine that never loses data:
- **100K+ requests/second** with <50ms redirect latency
- **Organization-aware authentication** via Warden integration
- **Complete data capture** - every header, parameter, request stored forever
- **Fire-and-forget architecture** - never block on downstream services

### ðŸ“Š Warehouse: Retroactive Analytics  
**"Understand Everything, Retroactively"**

The analytics API that makes historical data infinitely queryable:
- **Sub-second queries** on billion-row datasets
- **Retroactive campaign creation** for traffic that already happened
- **AI-powered pattern discovery** in unattributed data
- **Multi-touch attribution modeling** with complete customer journeys

### ðŸ’» Campaigns: Intelligent Management
**"Discover Patterns, Create Campaigns, Optimize Retroactively"**  

The React frontend that transforms insights into action:
- **Real-time campaign performance** monitoring
- **Retroactive campaign creation wizard** for discovered patterns
- **AI-suggested optimizations** based on historical data
- **Organization-native UX** with complete data isolation

## The Fundamental Problems We Solve

### 1. **Massive Traffic Goes Unattributed**
```
The Reality:
- 40-60% of marketing traffic has no campaign attribution
- This "dark traffic" often contains your best-performing patterns  
- You're competing against yourself without knowing it
- Successful campaigns get paused while profitable traffic goes unclaimed

The Trellis Solution:
- Capture 100% of traffic data regardless of attribution
- Retroactively create campaigns for discovered patterns
- Turn unattributed traffic into profitable campaigns
- Never lose another opportunity due to missing tracking
```

### 2. **Attribution Models Are Built on Lies**
```
The Truth:
- Last-click attribution ignores 70% of customer journey
- Platform-specific attribution creates conflicting "truth" 
- Multi-touch attribution requires data most systems don't collect
- Budget allocation based on incomplete information

The Trellis Solution:
- Complete customer journey data for accurate multi-touch attribution
- Organization-wide attribution consistency across all channels
- Retroactive application of new attribution models to historical data
- Budget optimization based on actual influence, not platform claims
```

### 3. **Time-Bound Intelligence Loss**
```
The Problem:
- Discover a winning pattern in January for October traffic? Too bad.
- Historical insights can't be turned into actionable campaigns
- Optimization is always 30-90 days behind actual performance
- Pattern discovery requires manual analysis of incomplete data

The Trellis Solution:
- Create campaigns for traffic that already happened
- Apply new intelligence to complete historical datasets
- AI automatically discovers profitable patterns in old data
- Time-travel your campaign optimization process
```

### 4. **Organization Data Mixing**
```
The Risk:
- Most attribution tools aren't built for true multi-tenancy
- Agency client data bleeds together in analytics platforms
- Enterprise teams accidentally see each other's campaigns
- Compliance nightmares for data-sensitive industries

The Trellis Solution:
- Organization-first architecture at every layer
- Complete data isolation with zero possibility of leakage
- Enterprise-grade security built into every component
- Multi-tenancy isn't an add-onâ€”it's foundational
```

## Why Existing Solutions Don't Work

### Google Analytics: Built for Content, Not Campaigns
- UTM parameters break with complex funnels
- Limited attribution models, no retroactive capability
- Campaign management completely separate from analytics
- Multi-touch attribution is approximation, not actual journeys

### Facebook/Google Ads: Walled Gardens  
- Can't see cross-platform customer journeys
- Each platform claims credit for same conversions
- No retroactive campaign creation capability
- Manual optimization based on platform-biased data

### Enterprise Analytics: Expensive, Complex, Slow
- 6-12 month implementations, millions in costs
- Requires technical teams for any analytical change
- Batch processing means hours-old "real-time" data
- Analytics completely disconnected from campaign management

### Attribution Tools: Single-Point Solutions
- Still require pre-defining what to track
- Limited or no campaign management capabilities
- Retroactivity impossible with incomplete historical data
- Organization isolation as afterthought, if at all

## The Trellis Advantage

When you can create campaigns retroactively and optimize based on complete historical data, you have capabilities that competitors literally cannot replicate:

### Perfect Information Advantage
- **Your campaigns** start with proven patterns from historical data
- **Their campaigns** start with guesses based on incomplete information
- **Your ROAS** improves over time as historical insights compound  
- **Their ROAS** plateaus due to limited learning from partial data

### Time Arbitrage
- **You optimize** campaigns before creating them using historical performance
- **They optimize** campaigns reactively after poor performance is already visible
- **Your insights** are predictive and based on complete customer journeys
- **Their insights** are reactive and based on single-platform attribution

### Organization Scale  
- **You apply** insights across all campaigns, teams, and time periods
- **They silo** insights by platform, team, and limited time windows
- **Your learning** accelerates as data volume and history grow
- **Their learning** plateaus due to organizational and temporal boundaries

## Real-World Impact Examples

### Scenario 1: The Mobile iOS Discovery
```
Traditional Approach:
- Notice iOS users convert well in monthly report
- Create iOS-targeted campaign for next month's traffic
- Miss 6 weeks of high-performing historical iOS traffic
- Never recover the lost opportunity value

Trellis Approach:
- AI discovers iOS pattern in 6 months of historical data
- Create retroactive campaign attributing all historical iOS traffic
- Apply learnings to optimize new iOS campaigns immediately  
- Capture 100% of historical + future iOS opportunity value
```

### Scenario 2: The Attribution Mystery
```
Traditional Approach:
- Facebook claims 80% credit for your conversions
- Google claims 75% credit for the same conversions
- Both can't be right, but which attribution is wrong?
- Make budget allocation decisions based on conflicting data

Trellis Approach:
- Complete customer journey data for every single conversion
- Accurate multi-touch attribution with real touchpoint sequence
- Budget allocation based on actual influence measurement
- 40% improvement in ROAS through correct attribution
```

### Scenario 3: The Pattern Discovery
```
Traditional Approach:
- Manually analyze campaign performance in monthly reviews
- Notice patterns only after they're already well-established
- Miss subtle but profitable micro-patterns in the noise
- Optimization limited by human analysis capacity

Trellis Approach:
- AI continuously analyzes all traffic for emerging patterns
- Automatically suggests campaigns based on historical performance
- Discovers profitable micro-patterns humans would never spot
- Optimization scales with data volume, not human analysis time
```

## The Competitive Moat

The Trellis platform creates multiple layers of competitive advantage that compound over time:

### 1. **Data Completeness Moat**
Once you have complete historical traffic data, competitors starting from scratch can never catch up to your analytical capabilities.

### 2. **Attribution Accuracy Moat** 
When your ROAS calculations are based on complete customer journeys while competitors use biased platform attribution, your optimization compounds while theirs fights itself.

### 3. **Pattern Recognition Moat**
As your historical dataset grows, AI pattern discovery becomes more accurate, creating a virtuous cycle of better insights leading to more profitable campaigns.

### 4. **Organization Scale Moat**
Enterprise customers can't switch attribution platforms without losing historical data, creating massive switching costs and customer lifetime value.

## The Future is Retroactive

The question isn't whether you need better campaign management and attribution. The question is whether you'll get retroactive campaign optimization capabilities before your competitors do.

**Traditional marketing attribution is like driving while only looking in the rearview mirror**â€”you can see where you've been, but you can't predict where you're going or optimize for conditions ahead.

**Trellis is like having a GPS with traffic prediction, automatic route optimization, and the ability to retroactively take better routes through time.**

The future of marketing is:
- **Retroactive** (optimize campaigns that already happened)
- **Organization-native** (enterprise-grade data isolation)  
- **AI-driven** (pattern discovery that scales with data)
- **Predictive** (know what will work before you spend)

We built the platform to make that future available today, because marketing attribution is too important to be broken, too valuable to be reactive, and too complex to be solved by anything less than a complete reimagining of the entire attribution pipeline.

The platform that can retroactively optimize your entire marketing history has already won. The only question is when you'll start using it.
