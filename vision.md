# Trellis Vision

## The Future of Traffic Intelligence

### Our North Star

**Make every byte of traffic data actionable, retroactively.**

Trellis will become the foundational layer for understanding how traffic flows through the internet. Not just for attribution, but for discovering patterns that drive business decisions we haven't even thought to ask about yet.

## The Journey

### Today: Universal Capture
*Where we are now*

- Capturing 100% of traffic data without loss
- Basic retroactive campaign creation
- SQL-accessible data warehouse
- Manual pattern discovery

**Success Metric**: Zero data loss, 100% traffic captured

### 6 Months: Intelligent Attribution
*Q2 2025*

#### Auto-Discovery Engine
```javascript
// System automatically discovers and suggests campaigns
{
  "discovered": "2025-03-15",
  "pattern": {
    "consistent_params": ["pid=1234", "src=meta"],
    "traffic_volume": 1.2M,
    "first_seen": "2024-12-01"
  },
  "suggestion": "This looks like Facebook Mobile App traffic from Partner #1234",
  "confidence": 0.94,
  "action": "Create campaign 'fb_mobile_partner_1234'?"
}
```

#### Multi-Touch Attribution
- See the complete journey, not just last-click
- Understand traffic interactions across touchpoints
- Apply different attribution models retroactively

**Success Metrics**: 
- 90% of traffic auto-attributed
- <1 hour from new pattern to suggested campaign

### 1 Year: Predictive Intelligence
*Q4 2025*

#### Traffic Quality Scoring
Every incoming request gets a real-time quality score:
```json
{
  "click_id": "abc123",
  "quality_score": 0.89,
  "factors": {
    "source_reputation": 0.95,
    "behavior_pattern": 0.87,
    "device_fingerprint": 0.85
  },
  "prediction": {
    "conversion_probability": 0.34,
    "lifetime_value_estimate": 127.50
  }
}
```

#### Anomaly Detection
- "Traffic from Source X dropped 50% in the last hour"
- "New unrecognized pattern detected with 10K clicks"
- "Potential click fraud detected from IP range Y"

#### Smart Routing
Dynamic routing based on real-time performance:
```yaml
campaign:
  rules:
    - if: quality_score > 0.8
      route_to: premium_endpoint
    - if: geo == "US" AND hour_of_day in [18,19,20]
      route_to: peak_traffic_handler
    - else:
      route_to: standard_endpoint
```

**Success Metrics**:
- Predict traffic quality with 85% accuracy
- Detect anomalies within 5 minutes
- Increase conversion rates by 25% through smart routing

### 2 Years: The Traffic Graph
*2026*

#### Relationship Mapping
Understanding the hidden connections in traffic:
- Which sources actually share users?
- What's the real overlap between campaigns?
- How do different traffic sources influence each other?

```
Facebook Ad → Blog Post → Email → Conversion
    ↓           ↓          ↓
  [30% overlap] [45% overlap] [12% overlap]
    ↓           ↓          ↓
Instagram ← Reddit Post ← Search Ad
```

#### Industry Benchmarking
Anonymous, aggregated insights across all Trellis users:
- "Your cost per click is 23% above industry average"
- "Similar companies see 3.4% conversion on this traffic type"
- "This new source is trending up 400% industry-wide"

#### API-First Ecosystem
Trellis becomes the backbone for other tools:
```javascript
// Other platforms can build on top of Trellis
const trellis = new TrellisSDK(apiKey);

// Custom attribution models
trellis.defineModel({
  name: "time_decay_with_source_weight",
  logic: customAttributionFunction
});

// Real-time webhooks
trellis.subscribe('traffic.anomaly.detected', handleAnomaly);
trellis.subscribe('pattern.discovered', suggestCampaign);
```

**Success Metrics**:
- Map 95% of traffic relationships
- 50+ integrated platforms
- Become the "source of truth" for traffic data

### 5 Years: Autonomous Traffic Optimization
*2029*

#### Self-Optimizing Campaigns
Campaigns that evolve without human intervention:
```yaml
campaign:
  mode: autonomous
  objective: maximize_quality_traffic
  constraints:
    - cost_per_click < $0.50
    - fraud_rate < 2%
  learning:
    - continuously_adjust_routing
    - discover_new_sources
    - optimize_timing
```

#### Cross-Network Intelligence
Share learned patterns across the entire network:
- "Users from Source A convert 3x better after seeing Source B"
- "Friday traffic from Region X has 90% bot probability"
- "This combination of parameters indicates premium traffic"

#### Natural Language Analytics
Ask questions in plain English:
```
You: "Why did our traffic quality drop last Tuesday?"

Trellis: "Traffic quality decreased 34% on Tuesday due to:
1. New source 'aff_9234' sent 45K clicks with 78% bot signatures
2. Your premium source reduced volume by 60% (likely budget exhaustion)
3. Time zone shift due to DST caused 2-hour gap in EU traffic

Recommended actions:
- Block aff_9234 (implemented automatically if approved)
- Increase premium source budget by $2K
- Adjust scheduling for DST changes"
```

**Success Metrics**:
- 50% reduction in manual campaign management
- 99.9% fraud detection accuracy
- Natural language understanding of 95% of queries

## Technical Evolution

### Infrastructure Scaling
```
2024: 200K requests/day → Single region, basic stack
2025: 5M requests/day → Multi-region, ClickHouse cluster

## The Principles We Won't Compromise

### 1. **Never Lose Data**
No matter how we evolve, every byte matters.

### 2. **Retroactive Intelligence**
The future should always be able to understand the past.

### 3. **Open Access**
Data should be queryable by humans and machines alike.

### 4. **Privacy First**
Growth without compromising user privacy.

### 5. **Developer Love**
APIs that developers actually want to use.

## The Trellis Manifesto

We believe that:

1. **Data has compounding value** - Today's noise is tomorrow's signal
2. **Attribution is a journey, not a destination** - It evolves as understanding deepens
3. **Patterns exist before we discover them** - Our job is to reveal, not create
4. **Every click tells a story** - We're building the library
5. **The best schema is no schema** - Flexibility enables discovery

## Call to Action

### For Engineers
Build the infrastructure that never forgets.

### For Analysts
Ask questions we haven't thought to ask yet.

### For Partners
Send us your traffic. We'll help you understand it.

### For the Industry
Let's stop losing data and start discovering insights.

## The End Goal

In 2029, when someone asks "How do we track this?", the answer will be simple:

**"It's already in Trellis."**

*Trellis: Where every click matters, forever.*

## Addendum: The Technical Moonshots

### Things We're Experimenting With

#### 1. Homomorphic Analytics
Query encrypted data without decrypting it:
```python
# Partners can analyze their data without us seeing it
encrypted_result = trellis.query(
    encrypted_query="SELECT COUNT(*) WHERE source='private'",
    encryption_key=partner_public_key
)
```

#### 2. Traffic DNA Fingerprinting
Every traffic source has a unique "DNA":
```json
{
  "source_dna": {
    "timing_pattern": [0.23, 0.45, 0.12],
    "geo_distribution": {"US": 0.6, "CA": 0.2, "UK": 0.2},
    "device_signature": "mobile_heavy_ios_skewed",
    "confidence": 0.97
  }
}
```

#### 3. Quantum Pattern Recognition
Using quantum computing for impossibly complex pattern matching:
- Find patterns across 100+ dimensions simultaneously
- Discover correlations invisible to classical computing
- Predict traffic changes before they happen

#### 4. The Traffic Time Machine
Complete historical reconstruction:
```javascript
// "What would have happened if we had this campaign in 2024?"
const alternate_history = trellis.simulate({
  campaign: new_campaign_rules,
  apply_to: "2024-01-01/2024-12-31",
  reality: "alternate"
});
```

#### 5. Neural Traffic Translation
Convert between any traffic format automatically:
```javascript
// Auto-translate between any affiliate network format
trellis.translate({
  from: "hasoffers_format",
  to: "cake_format",
  preserve: "attribution_integrity"
});
```

These moonshots might fail. But if even one succeeds, it changes everything.

**The future of traffic intelligence starts with never losing a single byte.**
