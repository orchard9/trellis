# Trellis Warehouse Vision

## The Future of Traffic Attribution Analytics

Trellis Warehouse represents the next evolution in traffic attribution and analyticsâ€”a system designed for the modern age of privacy-conscious, multi-touch customer journeys and retroactive campaign optimization.

## Our Vision

**"Understand Everything, Retroactively"**

Traditional analytics systems force you to define what you want to track before the data arrives. Trellis Warehouse flips this model: we capture everything first, then provide unlimited analytical flexibility to understand your traffic patterns months or years later.

## The Problem We Solve

### Current State of Analytics (Broken)
- **Pre-defined tracking**: Must know what to measure before traffic arrives
- **Data silos**: Campaign data separate from analytics, separate from attribution
- **Limited retroactivity**: Can't create campaigns for traffic that already happened
- **Single-touch attribution**: Last-click models miss the complexity of modern journeys
- **Vendor lock-in**: Analytics tied to specific ad platforms or tracking tools

### What We Enable (Revolutionary)
- **Complete data capture**: Every HTTP request, header, parameter captured forever
- **Infinite retroactivity**: Create campaigns for traffic from 2 years ago
- **Universal attribution**: Works with any traffic source, any conversion event
- **Organization isolation**: Enterprise-grade multi-tenancy with zero data leakage
- **Query flexibility**: SQL-level access to your complete traffic history

## Core Principles

### 1. Data Completeness Over Convenience
We store every possible data point because you can't retroactively collect data you didn't capture. Disk is cheap, insights are priceless.

### 2. Organization-First Architecture
Every query, every cache key, every log line is organization-aware. Multi-tenancy isn't an afterthoughtâ€”it's fundamental to our design.

### 3. Performance Through Intelligent Caching
Sub-second query performance on billion-row datasets through aggressive caching, pre-aggregation, and query optimization.

### 4. SQL-First Analytics
No proprietary query language, no limited dashboard builders. Direct SQL access to your data means unlimited analytical flexibility.

## Technical Philosophy

### Scale-First Design
```
Current traffic: 10M requests/day
Design target: 10B requests/day
Reason: When you discover a pattern, you want historical data immediately
```

### Privacy-First Approach
```
Data retention: 7 years (configurable per organization)
PII handling: Automatically detected and encrypted
Compliance: GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA ready out of the box
```

### Query-Optimized Storage
```
Row storage: Complete request context in ClickHouse
Columnar analytics: Pre-aggregated metrics for common queries  
Streaming: Real-time metrics with <10 second freshness
Archival: Automatic tiering to cheap storage after 2 years
```

## Unique Capabilities

### 1. Time-Travel Analytics
```sql
-- Find all traffic that would match a campaign created today
-- but applied to traffic from 6 months ago
SELECT count(*) as potential_attributed_traffic
FROM events 
WHERE organization_id = 'your_org'
  AND event_time BETWEEN '2023-07-01' AND '2023-12-31'
  AND source = 'facebook'
  AND medium = 'cpc'
  AND campaign_id IS NULL; -- unattributed traffic
```

### 2. Multi-Touch Attribution Modeling
```sql
-- Understand the complete customer journey
WITH customer_journey AS (
  SELECT 
    click_id,
    campaign_id,
    source,
    event_time,
    conversion_value,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY session_id ORDER BY event_time) as touch_sequence
  FROM events 
  WHERE organization_id = 'your_org'
    AND session_id IN (SELECT session_id FROM events WHERE conversion_value > 0)
)
SELECT 
  touch_sequence,
  source,
  avg(conversion_value) as attributed_value,
  count(*) as touch_count
FROM customer_journey
GROUP BY touch_sequence, source
ORDER BY touch_sequence;
```

### 3. Fraud Pattern Detection
```sql
-- Identify suspicious traffic patterns automatically
SELECT 
  source,
  country,
  device_type,
  count(*) as clicks,
  count(DISTINCT ip_address) as unique_ips,
  avg(fraud_score) as avg_fraud_score,
  clicks / unique_ips as clicks_per_ip
FROM events 
WHERE organization_id = 'your_org'
  AND event_time > now() - INTERVAL 24 HOUR
GROUP BY source, country, device_type
HAVING clicks_per_ip > 10 OR avg_fraud_score > 70
ORDER BY avg_fraud_score DESC;
```

### 4. Campaign Performance Prediction
```sql
-- Predict campaign performance based on historical patterns
WITH historical_performance AS (
  SELECT 
    source,
    medium,
    country,
    device_type,
    avg(conversion_rate) as historical_cvr,
    avg(conversion_value) as historical_aov
  FROM campaign_performance_daily
  WHERE organization_id = 'your_org'
    AND date BETWEEN now() - INTERVAL 90 DAY AND now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY
  GROUP BY source, medium, country, device_type
)
SELECT 
  h.*,
  r.estimated_daily_traffic,
  (h.historical_cvr * r.estimated_daily_traffic * h.historical_aov) as predicted_daily_revenue
FROM historical_performance h
JOIN traffic_projections r ON (h.source = r.source AND h.medium = r.medium)
ORDER BY predicted_daily_revenue DESC;
```
